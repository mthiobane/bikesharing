The overview of this project is to analyze bikeshare data from CitiBike in New York City and present it to the investor that wishes to invest on a similar business in Des Moines.
Des Moines is different of New York but the founding on the CitiBike in New York City analysis will help the investor project themselves.
In this analysis will identify:
* The Costumers that use the Bikeshare program?
* In which the bikes are used in New York?
* Determine the time the bike are uses the most ?
* Analyze the breakdown of the use of the bike by gender ?

## Results:
### Costumer details
The use of the bike is very popular in New York City as the number of rides for one month is up to 2 344 224 Rides. So we can imagine that people are interested in bikeshare program and investing in this business in Des Moines will be successful.
If we look closely to our findings, we can see the ¾ of the users are Subscribers. This mean that the revenues of this business are constant and can be project over time. Also, it shows us that the bike are frequently uses so it needs to be repaired we will determine the best time to do so later.
Regarding the gender breakdown we see that the bikeshare program is mostly use by Male. So, in a commercial point of view, we can center of advertise on female in order to enroll then in the program when we launch it in Des Moines.

### The localization of the bike
We observe that the bikes are mostly use in Manhattan the city center.
we can assume that the bikeshare program is fit for a very dense city with high traffic as Manhattan can be. Also, as we are in the month of August the bikeshare program might be use by tourist to visit the city. They might represent the high number of unsubscribe to. So, a dense and tourist city needs this kind of program.
Also, we can observe that the Ride Starting and Ride Ending location are the same. This situation can be liked to the fact that the subscribers represent ¾ of the users use the services of the bikeshare program to go to a specific place time and come back to the same place. We will be able to confirm this hypothesis with the trips during weekdays to know when they use the program.

### Time Bikes are used the most and the breakdown by gender,
Most if the time the bike is use for less that 30 min as we can see in the graph trip duration and men use the bike longer than female when we to look at the Trip Duration by Gender.

We can observe on Trips during Weekdays graph that the bikes are used during the hole week but in different hours
From Monday to Friday, the bikes are use from 7 am to 9 am and from 5 to 7pm. These hours match with the period of rush as a lot of people is going to work or come back from work. So we can assume that in a dense city as NYC people prefer to use the bikeshare program to avoid traffic. 
During the weekend the story is different because bike is mostly use from 9am to 6pm. We can imagine that user change their behaver during the weekend and use the bike to enjoy the city. 
So, the bikeshare program is important for costumer as an alternative to the traffic and for pleasure during weekend.
### Trips during Weekdays ![Trips during Weekdays](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89410157/144351350-00f24965-d739-4e6e-b088-84076c6b4a11.png)

Trips during Weekdays by Gender graph shows us that Female use the bike on a regular basis in the same schedule but as seen before men are more intensive users.

The User Trips By gender by Weekday graph is more significant because we see that regarding subscriber Male use more the bikeshare program from Monday to Friday that female.

## Summary:
Is sum we can say that the bikeshare program is very successful in NYC and it is mostly use by Male. It helps to avoid traffic regarding the hours they are mostly used also it is used for pleasure during the weekend. Des Moines is a small town with a population of 215,636 people, so if we compare to New York the needs will not be same. But the interesting point is that the number of subscribers is very high compares to costumers; this mean that people are very interest in this program and will use it for fun during weekend and for work for the rest of the week. Even if New York is a big city, we observe that bikes are mostly used in the city centrum only. So as Des Moines is a small city, we can assume that the bikeshare program will be successful as bike are used in a small area. 
Finally, we can advise to do the maintenance of the by, between midnight and 5 am the bike as less use during that period of time.
